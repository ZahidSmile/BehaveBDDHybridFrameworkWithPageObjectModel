You'll need to install the following dependencies:

Selenium WebDriver: This library allows you to control web browsers and interact with web elements.
Behave: Behave is a BDD (Behavior-driven development) framework for Python that allows you to write tests using Gherkin syntax.
Allure-behave: Allure-behave is a plugin for Behave that generates Allure-compatible reports, which provide detailed information about test execution.
Allure-pytest: Allure-pytest is a library that provides integration between Python testing frameworks (such as Behave) and Allure reporting.
Additionally, you'll need to install the specific WebDriver for the browser(s) you plan to automate. Here's how you can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install selenium
pip install behave
pip install allure-behave
pip install allure-pytest
